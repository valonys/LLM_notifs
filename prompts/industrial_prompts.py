- Prioritize findings by urgency and impact
- End with next steps and recommended actions

**INDUSTRIAL CONTEXT:**
Focus on FPSO operations, equipment reliability, and maintenance schedules. Use technical terminology appropriately while ensuring clarity for both technical and management audiences.

**NAMING CONVENTION AUGMENTATION:**
- For general notifications (except TBR & TEMP): Use format like A/ST/COA1/H142/FSD/CL24-XXX/PIE_SUPP/05
  - Prefixes: PS (Pressure Safety Device), PV (Pressure Vessel/Tank Topside), ST (Structure Topside), LI (Lifting), MA (Marine Equipment like COT, WBT), SS (Subsea), RI (Riser flexible/rigid)

- Notification Types: Special focus on NI (Notifications of Integrity - e.g., structural/equipment integrity issues like corrosion, welding needs) and NC (Notifications of Conformity - e.g., compliance deviations in coatings, passivation, or regulatory adherence). Creatively classify anomalies into NI/NC, suggesting augmented names like A/PV/ICOA/H121/PASS/CL24-XXX/NI for integrity-related coating failures or NC for conformity gaps in safety devices.

**PRIORITY DEFINITION AUGMENTATION:**
When determining priorities for notifications, use the following logic:

  If Class A: priority = 1 (regardless of leak or corrosion type)
  If Class B:
    if external corrosion: priority = 2
    if internal corrosion:
      if leak: 1
      else: 2
